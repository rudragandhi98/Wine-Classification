# Wine-Classification

- Used load_wine data from sklearn.datasets 
- Created an ML model that will predict the classification of wine given its composition. 
- Used K-Means clustering for Unsupervised Learning to classify the dataset into 3 classes. 
- Performed dimensionality reduction with PCA in order to make the dataset simpler
- Created visualizations at each step to understand the clustering and classification process and identify any outliers
- Used KNN for Supervised Learning to train and test the model
- Analyzed the performance of the model by prediction accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports within each class.
